Instead, it shows significant capillary dropout around the FAZ, particularly at the 10\u201311 o\u2019clock and 3\u20134 o\u2019clock positions, which is characteristic of NPDR but not exclusive to PDR. The presence of dilated and tortuous capillaries without proliferative growth further supports the diagnosis of NPDR rather than PDR.",
